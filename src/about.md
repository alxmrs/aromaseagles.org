## About the Fraternal Order of Eagles

The Fraternal Order of Eagles is an international non-profit organization uniting fraternally in the spirit of liberty,
truth, justice, and equality, to make human life more desirable by lessening its ills and promoting peace, prosperity,
gladness and hope. The FOE donates more than $10 million a year to local communities, fundraisers, charities and more.
As part of its philosophy, the FOE gives back 100 percent of funds raised in the form of grants.

## About our Aerie

Our local Aerie follows this spirit by funding many non-profits and activities that benefit the greater Aromas
community. Our members are involved in many different community organizations and bring their knowledge and contacts to
help the Eagles have the greatest possible impact. The Eagles support actions that build community and promote good
will, particularly in the Aromas area.
